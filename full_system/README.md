# SmartCrutch
Imperial College London EEE Human-Centered Robotics Research Project

## Introduction
The purpose of this project was to investigate how a sensor-enabled crutch could be used to improve injury recovery, through:
- Regular feedback for the patient and physicians on use and gate with the crutches
- A 3D video tracking system to provide the patient with feedback on their exercise technique

The full research paper containing the group's findings can be found here.

This repository contains all the schematics, code and instructions required to reconstruct the system, and continue the research.
